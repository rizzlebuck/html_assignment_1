Module 1 HTML Assignment
========================

This is my submission for the HTML Knowledge Check assignment. I created a complete HTML5 page that includes all the required parts plus a few bonus elements.

Here's what I added:

1. Contact Form:
- Includes text input for Name
- Email input
- Textarea for Message
- Submit button
- BONUS: Added radio buttons for "How did you find us?" (Google, Social Media)

2. Product Table:
- Displays product name, price, and quantity
- 3 rows of product data
- BONUS: Header row added to label the columns

3. Navigation Bar:
- Used a <nav> element with an unordered list
- Includes links for Home, About, and Contact

4. Images:
- Added one placeholder image from https://placehold.co
- BONUS: Added another image with a rounded border using the style attribute

Other Notes:
- Page is mobile responsive using the viewport meta tag
- Basic inline CSS used for layout and styling
- Code is commented and organized for readability

Let me know if there's anything I missed!
